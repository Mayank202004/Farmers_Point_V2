  "description": "Pomegranate is a fruit-bearing shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. Known for its juicy red seeds, pomegranate is a rich source of antioxidants and vitamin C, often used in juices, salads, and culinary dishes. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions and is valued for its health benefits.",
